### Hi, I'm Philip

* I wrote a book, [Writing for Software Developers](https://philipkiely.com/wfsd) and it would mean the world to me if you read it.
* Check out repositories like devices.css for my small open-source projects
* Many of my repositories connect to [articles written for clients](https://philipkiely.com/essays/posts.html).
